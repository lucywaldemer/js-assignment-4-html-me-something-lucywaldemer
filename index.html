   <p>Right now I am making this website, sitting at my kitchen table, on my laptop. Listening to the wind howling in the canopy outside of trees above me. We live in a contrasting world of pervasive <b>nature</b> and oozing <b>technology</b>. Human impact everywhere. I am an artist, a teacher, a coder, a storyteller. And much more. I am a human being. I am many lives lived and many lives to be lived. Here is my story in no particular order. And of no great detail.</p>
<h2 id="mainHeading">The Art</h2>

<main>I was born to two creative adults. An architect/jack of all trades/high-pitch giggle, rosy cheeked father. And a graphic designer/badass/I can do anything better than a man could & give you a grilled cheese afterward-type-mother. The two creatives already had a son, Grant, who was my favorite and only brother. The four of us played, made food, learned life skills, and made lots and lots of art. Art of all kinds. Drawing and performing. Dancing and crafting. Tinkering and remodeling. Parents lived like children while teaching their kids things adults don't know how to do. Independednce and community were rooted in this family dynamic. And art was always part of community. Art was an escape, and a destination. Art was a joy. Art was a communicator. Art told stories, made houses, put food on our table. What isn't art?</main>

<h3>The Pull of Nature</h3></body>
<article>Nature has always pulled me in. As a child I spent so much time in my mother's gardens, inspired by the world we live on. Nature is a constant in my life, and has always guided me. Nature is much like love. It is always around us, always present and in abundance. And yet, sometimes it seems far. Broken. Unattainable. It is the solution to our fears and problems, but it can be hard to identify. Hard to protect. It can be chaotic and cruel. It can be a reminder of painful things. Like love, we are a part of it, we are it, and we also do not know. It is a feeling. A union. A vibe. The wind is intuition. Shallow grass roots are nerve endings. The seasons of our lives are planned in spontaneity.  </article>
